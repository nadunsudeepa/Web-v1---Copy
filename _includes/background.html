      I am currently in my second year of academic studies towards a 
      Higher National Diploma in Software Engineering at the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM).

      I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
